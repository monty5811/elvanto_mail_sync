Small webapp to sync Elvanto group members to mailing lists run on a Google
apps domain.

**NOTE** this may destroy all your data - this has not been fully tested yet!!

## Features

 - Whitelist access to particular users
 - Prevent syncing of an email address (On a per group or a global level)
 - Enable automated syncing for individual groups

## Installation

This app should run comfortably on Heroku's free tier providing you do not sync too frequently. (Syncing every half hour leaves plenty of spare time.)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

 - Create credentials on google TODO: link
 - Click the push to deploy button
 - Add secrets as config variables on heroku
 - Sign into the app with a user that has admin rights on your google apps domain
 - Sync your emails

Setup recurring tasks to sync the data with the command `python manage.py elvanto2google`

## Limitations

 - Roles on the mailing lists are not yet supported - coming soon!
 - If you have more than 1000 people in Elvanto only the first 1000 will be synced, this will also be fixed soon!
