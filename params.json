(Syncing every half hour leaves plenty of spare time.)\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\r\n\r\n - Create credentials on google TODO: link\r\n - Click the push to deploy button\r\n - Add secrets as config variables on heroku\r\n - Scale the worker dyno up to 1\r\n - Setup a recurring task to run the command `python manage.py elvanto2google` using the scheduler addon\r\n - Sign into the app with a user that has admin rights on your google apps domain\r\n - Sync your emails\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n - Roles on the mailing lists are not yet supported - coming soon!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions. However, to make things as easy as possible, please fork this repo and then create a new feature branch and work in that - it makes things far [easier](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/).\r\n","google":"UA-53156632-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
